Introduction: Ensuring secure online communication is crucial for protecting sensitive information and verifying the authenticity of digital transactions. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the core technologies that safeguard internet communications.    

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): PKI is a security framework that employs cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt information, offering key services like authentication, encryption, and digital signatures. It uses a pair of keys— public and private—to secure data. Public keys, which are shared openly, are used for encryption, while private keys, kept confidential, are used for decryption. PKI relies on trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to issue digital certificates, which verify the identities of entities and build a chain of trust.
